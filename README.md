Voron 2.4r2 - V2.6622 Config

This is my Voron 2.4r2, started building in September 2023. This started with a FormBot pro kit, plus many mods. I picked these mods after researching the downsides of a stock V2.4; some electronic, some printed; all carefully chosen to fit and work with each other. I wanted a printer that fits my printing desires, so I built it. This repository is my software config of my Voron 2.4r2 Sn: V.6622
